# GUI Temp

This GUI template is designed for use in modded copies of Gorilla Tag on Quest. It supports sections, toggleable/untogglable buttons, notifications, and more. It’s lightweight, customizable, and meant for developers familiar with C#. If you're not comfortable with C#, this might not be for you.

No, it's not required. I appreciate it, but at the end of the day I have bigger problems.

Nope! You’re welcome to use it in your projects, or even copy parts of the code to help with your own GUI.
